# multistepformv1
A project called Multistep form from frontendmentor free.

In this project i force myself to use regex so i could start learning. It was hard in the first moment but i was getting easier while i start to understand how to catch groups and how to manipulate it.

There are a lot of function i could remake and made it better in this project. But i'll let it to the project in your second version.
